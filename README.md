This is collection of small web-apps which I developed during my study on the physical faculty of the Lomonosov Moscow State Univerity. Mostly they related to astronomy, but some of them are not like SNAKE game or random moving.
After graduation I made several android apps and one of them AstroAge has a web version on this webpage.
